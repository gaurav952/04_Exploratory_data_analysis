## Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

### Dataset:
[Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) [20Mb]
</br>
### Description:
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

</br>
<b> 1.Date:</b>
Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
</br>
<b> 2.Time:</b>
time in format hh:mm:ss
</br>
<b> 3.Global_active_power: </b>
household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
</br>
<b> 4.Global_reactive_power:</b>
household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
</br>
<b> 5.Voltage: </b>
minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
</br>
<b> 6.Global_intensity:</b>
household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
</br>
<b> 7.Sub_metering_1:</b>
energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
</br>
<b> 8.Sub_metering_2:</b>
energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
</br>
<b> 9.Sub_metering_3:</b>
energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
